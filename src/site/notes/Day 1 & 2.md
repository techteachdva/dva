We're going to cover:
	Procedures.
	Who am I?
	Who are you?


# Procedures:
## Arrival
### Come in and get to your seat quietly and quickly.
### Take a look at the board and do the "DO NOW!"


## Chromebooks
### Only use your Assigned Chromebook.
Chromebooks are labeled A-Z (26).
Chromebooks are assigned in Alphabetical Order for each class period roster.
Be Kind to the Keys.
Only use Chromebooks as assigned as needed.
## HTC Vive
### The VR Equipment must be handled appropriately.
The VR Equipment is Mr. Phil's and if it is broken we will no longer be able to use it.
### Always use the hand-straps on the wand remotes.
Just in case.
### Be mindful of the headset cord when using VR.
Keep it behind you and don't spin around and get caught in a loop.
### When your turn is over, take the headset off quickly and carefully.
### DO NOT use the VR if you are sick or feel sick.
