**Teaching with Critical Theory**   Which literary theories guided literature instruction in your student experiences? What are you seeing in use in field experience classroom(s).  Which theories are you most likely to explore in your own classroom? Why?


Michael Ryan (1998) offers a somewhat more sinister definition of ideology:

"The term ideology describes the beliefs, attitudes, and habits of feeling, which a society inculcates in order to generate an automatic reproduction of its structuring premises. Ideology is what preserves social power in the absence of direct coercion. (p. 37)

It is what Norman Fairclough (1989) has dubbed “ideological common sense.” He writes, “Ideological common sense is common sense in the service of sustaining unequal relations of power” (the common sense of "teachers speak while students listen")


For those who say we should teach literature “neutrally,” I offer the perspective of literary scholar Shirley Staton (1987):
Contemporary theory holds that there is no such thing as an innocent, value-free reading. Instead, each of us has a viewpoint invested with presuppositions about “reality” and about ourselves, whether we are conscious of it or not. People who deny having a critical stance, who claim they are responding “naturally” or being “completely objective,” do not know themselves. (p. 43)
