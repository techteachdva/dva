Read Beers, Part 1. Reading Matters, and from Part 3. Word Work, chapters 13 “Fluency & Automaticity,” 14-“Spelling,” & 15-“Phonics”

Beers (2025). _When Kids Can't Read - What Teachers Can Do: A Guide for Teachers 4-12_. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt K-12. [https://ecampus.vitalsource.com/books/9780325171098](https://ecampus.vitalsource.com/books/9780325171098)

**What types of instructional and assessment practices can teachers use to support adolescent readers?**

For Vocabulary: Pretest-Check Test- Final Test. The more feedback they can get on their learning, the better. Do not use the "louder and slower" method. It just annoys people. Students need extra time to read. Students that are poor readers need to read whatever they are comfortable with as much as they can in order to stretch their brain muscles to become more skilled readers. Allowing time for reading for less skilled readers is an essential part of practice. A teacher can't assume everyone will read independently at the same pace, and a teacher reading aloud a section of text ahead of personal reading time has been researched to improve reading outcomes. Beers (2025) page 216:

*"Students need to hear fluent reading in order to become fluent readers. Make sure as you are reading aloud to students, you are modeling good expression, good phrasing, and good pacing. Keep in mind that you can model fluent reading by reading aloud just a few pages from the chapter students are reading or the short story they are about to read. Smith (1979) reminds us that when students listen to a teacher read aloud a few pages of a text they are about to read on their own, and follow along as the teacher reads, these students then complete the story with better fluency and accuracy."*

**3 Most Important Ideas from the Readings:**

1) There are specific patterns of behaviors of unskilled readers that can be diagnosed and paired with targeted interventions to aid the rapid acquisition of meaningful reading skills. There is always hope and always something a teacher can do to help. The more we know, the more we know what to do.
2) Beers 2025 page 225:
   *"The move from pretest–check test–final test to get-then-test did stream-line instruction, but this did not serve students well. That first pretest focused students’ attention and the Wednesday check test provided needed feedback. Additionally, the original pattern for instruction (pretest, check test, final test) also included returning to words missed on the weekly Friday test for monthly and yearly review. (Perhaps you remember the six-weeks spelling test that reviewed the previously learned one hundred words?) This type of constant review helped solidify learning (Rohrer 2015)."*
3) Prompt, DON'T CORRECT. I have been accidentally breaking this rule. I would like to do a better job to remember to prompt and not correct students when they are reading. I don't have many opportunities to have students read aloud, as most of my classwork is independent reading and writing, but I could create more opportunities for students to read from the board or read their answers out loud to share with the class.
