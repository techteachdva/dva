My love of writing started in 8th Grade with Mrs. J. I have two core memories with her. 
Of course, I’ll never forget the time I forged my Mother’s signature on my progress report, and I got to see Mrs. J’s disappointed look. I put immense pressure on myself to excel at school, and when I fell short of perfect, I tried to cover my own tracks out of shame. But I loved Mrs. J. I didn’t fault her for catching me in a lie and having a serious discussion with me. My other memory of her sticks out stronger. I vividly remember the first thing I wrote that I was really proud of because of the way she celebrated my work. I will never forget what she said to me: “You have a gift. Never stop writing.” I took her compliments and encouragement to heart. She helped me realize that I had the power to change people’s hearts and minds and affect real change with just words on a page. That felt like true magical power. I never stopped writing.

When I was taught ELA in High School, I was already interested in English and writing. 
I learned that there are givers and there are takers. I will never forget that gem from our reading of Ishmael by Daniel Quinn. I want to be a giver. I will never forget writing and designing for our school literary magazine Arister. I submitted several pieces. What was the common thread through it all? Curiosity, Critical Analysis, Creativity. And Mr. F.. He was my captain of my own Dead Poets Society. “Myths, Dreams, and Cultures” was the single best course I ever took. We read widely and discussed broadly. We wrote boldly and dreamed Brobdingnagian (that is to say, gigantic). It was a veritable smorgasbord of ideas, and all of them led to exciting conclusions. Guided by the gentle yet forceful teaching of Mr F. there was a definite disillusionment with certain ideas of Catholicism and Capitalism. He was pivotal in developing my perspective into a mature point of view. He taught me how to choose what to believe in, how to defend it intellectually, and when to change the parameters of a debate. 

He taught us never to be a Gort. A Gort, you should know, is someone who believes “that which is so is so.” A closed-minded person who dutifully believes what they’re told. The alternative to being a Gort, of course, is knowing that “that which is so, is not always so.” That is to say, the structures of power that exist in the world exist there because of deliberate actions, and their chosen history reflects this. Things are not preordained. Just because something has “always been that way” does not mean it must always continue as such. When the status quo protects itself, it asserts that “that which is so, is so”. Mr F. warned us never to be a Gort. And all these years later, I can see why. The status quo is threatened by the divergent, the anomalous, and the outsiders. I strive to stave off any Gortness I find in my own thoughts. I try to never be a Gort.

Decades later, I still think about Mrs. J and Mr. F and how they ignited my love for writing and directed me through reading that shaped my perspectives I still see through today. Literacy became my compass, offering a path when the way is unclear. And because of my awesome teachers, I also know three stars to guide me: to never stop writing, never be a Gort, and never stop teaching.
