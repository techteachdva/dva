"But when research shows one book a day can give a child a million-word advantage, then as a nation, we are required to ensure all children have access to books. To do less creates an inequity among children that is more than wrong; it is shameful. This million-word gap, more often than not, is another example of systemic problems we must, as a nation, overcome." Beers (2025)

****3 Levels of Practice****
"**Deliberate Practice:** Individuals practice following the steps:
1. A highly qualified teacher who will work with a student to assess how the student is progressing. Those assessments guide decisions about what to do next.
2. The teacher sets goals for each practice session. The teacher must explain these goals so that the student understands what he is trying to accomplish before attempting the practice. 
3. The teacher provides feedback about the practice. 
4. The teacher expects ongoing and repeated practice."

**Purposeful Practice:** Individuals try on their own to improve purposefully, but they do not have the input of a teacher.

**Naïve Practice:** Individuals practice simply because they are doing something: playing baseball with friends, riding a bike on a Saturday afternoon, baking a cake for a party. There is no purposeful thinking about what one is doing so as to improve and there is no teacher guiding the practice."

"We test reading comprehension but do not expect students to comprehend content by reading it." Beers (2025)


Dialogic talk is asking questions without easy answers, to test for comprehension.
Monologic talk is asking "quiz questions" or testing for basic memory of elements.
Dialogical talk is something I feel I already do well and now I can focus on it with a better understanding the importance of it for transferring real comprehension skills.


I NEED TO READ OUT ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS ON MY ASSIGNMENTS.
I realized during the readings that some of my students are not reading the instructions on the assignment sheets I give them. I keep running into the same problems in all my classes, so I have to conclude that the squeaky wheel is me and I need to change my approach. I realized during my reading that if I want more of my students to read the instructions on the sheets, self-directed, then first I should enact a series of steps of reading them aloud, then reading them aloud with the students reading along, then setting them loose to do their reading on their own. If I teach in this sequence, over time I should (in theory) get more overall comprehension of the assignment sheets, which I have discovered they are having difficulty parsing without more scaffolding. I can use my assignment sheets as a text for them to study and get more proficient with reading and comprehension.
