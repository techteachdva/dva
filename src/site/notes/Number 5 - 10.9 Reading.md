What are your 3 most important take aways from this week texts about meaningful _after reading activities_ for adolescents?

Somebody Wanted But So
Reviewing a scaffold afterwards, debriefing with the class, can help build transferable skills. Making teaching methods transparent and explicit can empower students to use these skills outside the class period. 

	"I don't know, Stuff Happens"

Retelling Scaffolding (Rubrics)
Showing students a rubric can help guide and focus their thinking. If a reader struggles with just saying "i don't know, stuff happens", give them a rubric to remind them of the quality of their retelling.

The Big Three Questions
*"The Three Big Questions scaffold avoids the pitfalls of Reciprocal Reading while encouraging responsible and responsive reading and discussions that improve comprehension (Beers and Probst 2016)."*

	! What is surprising?
	? What does the author think I already know? (What confused you?)
	C What changed, challenged, or confirmed what I already know?

*"It’s the third question, though, that you want to be sure becomes your final question: What has changed, challenged, or confirmed your thinking? Reading doesn’t change us, but it gives us the opportunity to change ourselves. End your conversations with this question to remind students that reading empowers them."*
