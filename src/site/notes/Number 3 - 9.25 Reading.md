**What are the best practices for teaching vocabulary?**
Instructing about Homographs (words that sound the same but have different meanings).




**How does this differ from practices you experienced as an adolescent learner?**





**What are your 3 most important take aways from this week readings about reading instruction for adolescents?**

If a student is struggling with Tier 1 words that needs to be addressed before meaningful work can be done with Tier 2 words. Students need a level of automaticity with Tier 1 words in order to have the cognitive energy to acquire new Tier 2 words.


It would be beneficial to have a "vocabulary meeting" with all of Middle school teachers to have a discussion focused around common academic language (Tier 2 words). If we could come up with a list of words we want to repeatedly and collectively use, we could really enhance students' learning these important Tier 2 words.
