**What are the best practices for teaching vocabulary?**
Instructing about Homographs (words that sound the same but have different meanings).
Teaching Tier 2 words by linking them to appropriate Tier 1 words.
Teaching Tier 2 words should make up the bulk of instructional time, not Tier 3 words.
Be as transparent and as clear as possible. Avoid ambiguity, sarcasm, or inferences. 

Beers (2025) page 180 *"The more you let ideas from individuals or groups percolate to the surface so all can consider them, the more everyone benefits."* One student's struggle could lead to better understanding for the entire class if addressed intentionally.

Beers (2025) page 184 *"These findings have serious implications for how we spend time in the classroom. If teaching specific words won’t help students comprehend a text that doesn’t have those words, should we spend our time teaching specific words? The answer is yes because such instruction will help with those texts. If we are pre-teaching some vocabulary, then choosing the rights words is critical."*


**How does this differ from practices you experienced as an adolescent learner?**
I feel like I can remember some pre-teaching of vocabulary words, but what I most remember is underlining or highlighting new words in a text. From what I can remember I think I enjoyed learning vocabulary and then using the new vocabulary I learned. The vocabulary lessons that still stand out the most to me is in Freshman year English in High School, Mrs. M. would have an ongoing homework assignment. We had to look up the Dictionary.com word of the Day and then we had to write it in a sentence that made sense. I'm not sure if this practice would be appropriate for Middle Schoolers, but I could make my own Words of the Day and challenge students to use it in a complete sentence. 


**What are your 3 most important take aways from this week readings about reading instruction for adolescents?**

If a student is struggling with Tier 1 words that needs to be addressed before meaningful work can be done with Tier 2 words. Students need a level of automaticity with Tier 1 words in order to have the cognitive energy to acquire new Tier 2 words.


It would be beneficial to have a "vocabulary meeting" with all of Middle school teachers to have a discussion focused around common academic language (Tier 2 words). If we could come up with a list of words we want to repeatedly and collectively use, we could really enhance students' learning these important Tier 2 words.
