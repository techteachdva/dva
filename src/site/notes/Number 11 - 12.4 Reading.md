This seems like the hardest and most important part of an ELA teachers job.
To teach students to read the word and then read the world. 
To show students different perspectives and to set them free to play with possibilities. 
Seeing things through a variety of lenses allows students to better understand complex texts, and read the textual evidence of their own lives to write their own sprawling narratives however they will the world of words to flow.

Teaching powerful, relevant nonfiction and critical media literacy was something that Mr. F was teaching us in Myths, Dreams, & Cultures, my favorite class ever. Among other books, we read "In the Absence of the Sacred" by Jerry Mander. Just a little light non-fiction about how "technological progress" has tread over the lives of native cultures around the world. That class and the readings we did shifted my perspectives on the world to a more mature one. Being able to participate in critical inquiry of non-fictional narratives, allowed me to see the world with new eyes.

*"This idea that history is “decided”—that certain stories are retold until they become mythologized, while others are omitted—is a powerful step toward students’ empowerment as critical readers."*
(Malchow Lloyd and Wertsch, 2016)

Teaching students to read between the lines of their lives and of history and of public narratives like politics and social reforms opens up a world to them that would be shut otherwise. Without introspection and critical analysis of texts, things are accepted at face value, it is what it is. Mr. F. taught me "that which is so, is not always so." to teach me this very concept, that history is a series of facts but many of these facts have been curated and intentionally edited. History is written by the winners and the losers narrative is omitted, stifled, or silenced. 

I think a key idea from the reading I can take away is that backwards design saves the day yet again. Framing an overarching question, stating a grand goal to reach first. Then walking backwards to what is necessary to get there. Then sprinkling in formative assessments like markers along the way, with summative assessments at major areas of interest. Mapping out a journey you plan a mind to walk down to lead to higher levels of thinking. Starting small, brick by brick building towards a tower of knowing. Atop this foundation the student can take a step back and admire the view from such a lofty height. But the tower must be visualized by the architect first, then built from the ground upwards. 

Critical media literacy practices and powerful nonfiction reading allows students to build their own towers of knowing, it builds non-reliance on seeking truths from ivory towers behind gilded gates. They have all that they need already, they just need a little scaffolding to build it tall and sturdy. So an experienced architect can give them the plans, give them the tips, give them the means to build their own knowledge on solid ground to raise them to higher levels of thought and being. 

*"Through questioning the bias, values, and points of view of media messages, students recognize that messages can never be completely objective and neutral; they always involve relationships of power."*
