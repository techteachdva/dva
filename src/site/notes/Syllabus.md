Game Design Syllabus

  

In this course we will learn: the history of tabletop games, and we will learn how to create our own tabletop games by playing, analyzing, and learning about classic games.

  

This class is hard. This class is fun. Fun is hard to create. That is why this class is both challenging and rewarding. Expect to be creatively pushed and put to work here. Yes we will play games, but we will also analyze them critically and ask tough questions without easy answers. First, we will learn about the history of games and we will play a lot of classic games in class. We will build up a shared vocabulary and understanding of design and mechanics and gameplay. Then we will set out to make our own unique designs in class.

  

We will cover the following Standards from the Information & Technology Educators of Minnesota (ITEM).

Strand 1. Inquire/Design

Students will develop strategies and/or design processes to find information/solutions relevant to their question or personal need.

ITEM 1.1: Formulate questions about a personal interest or curricular topic.

ITEM 1.2: Use evidence to investigate questions. 

ITEM 1.3: Deliver and implement a plan to fill knowledge gaps.

ITEM 1.4: Interact with content presented by others.

ITEM 1.5: Use reflection to guide informed decisions.

ITEM 1.6: Know and use a deliberate design process for generating ideas, testing theories, creating innovative artifacts, or solving authentic problems.

ITEM 1.7: Exhibit tolerance for ambiguity, perseverance, and capacity to work with open-ended problems.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcLU2D1Qdy8Sc83MGO-dTyUt5k2PBjNKnfXtNZ_7DxoQBAmF4T3Z0ctUZH0taS6OYL_tce0hL_egp5fpx_aX2sDn4XCghLIpKEPLxoOsVWrZTGvuCSdkqJnof7q0rwuC3bBTcWG?key=tjvZtyoxtCD7lIrQvsz4BA)![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfpKoy_2Z6DoQ3tIUAkw6qGe_2isO6bODiZ5XtHDbGMtLjugGiiKQLxfJkU4p5Q_vWkw-wd0Sc34SQnnHBS_hy9bjf7Oz6KzBiVta7rnN1kzSlfls8-XSOjc3UmNe6vndrZ80kz7g?key=tjvZtyoxtCD7lIrQvsz4BA)![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcVHnvbLlnI9nkr4D2y7Z8f_fvYmPl14Vlb54Wl6LPByfE6hSu1MNq6kYY72p8TrLn5mhPE2Z9EH6huhDvL3T6dL_KnVC8ydMoBdaoLAL-vYFMI5vOiUvtJvT8NjnlOnLCiZpYk?key=tjvZtyoxtCD7lIrQvsz4BA)

Your Final Grade= Avg. of (Participation+Game Studio Documentation+Game Projects 1, 2, & 3)

Part of getting a good grade in this class is how you participate. Show up as your best self. If you play by the rules of the game, (do the worky work to get the funny fun, patronizing-free zone, no slurs, etc.) you will get 100% participation. 

Being in the classroom is 50% of your Participation Grade. Show up on time, prepared, and you got it. Actually participating and doing the designing and discussions and playtesting is important to your grade and to the overall culture of the class. That’s the other 50% of Participation you bring to the table.

We will spend a lot of time in the beginning of this class learning and trying a variety of different modern games. We will dissect them and discuss why they work and what good design choices the designers made. We will learn from these games a variety of different mechanics and tools that we will then use in our own designs.

Then we will dive into working on making a two player competitive game. 

Then we will work on a 4 player competitive game.

Finally we will create a game of our choice. Ideally, a revision of one of our previous games.

  

Individual vs. Group Work

  

Design often starts as a solo activity, but collaboration is essential for a successful process. Others provide fresh perspectives that can catch mistakes or spark improvements we might miss alone. Sharing your work and accepting feedback helps refine your ideas and methods. Collaboration can also inspire new ideas for everyone involved—so take the risk and share!

  

In this course, you can choose to work individually as a "Solo-Designer." This means more work but also more creative freedom. You still must present your work and accept feedback, and you’ll be responsible for completing all assignments on your own. (Solo-Designers still need to create a Game Studio, just like groups.)

  

Alternatively, you can work in a group of 2 to 5 people—a “Game Studio.” Groups larger than five are discouraged to keep things manageable.

  

All Game Studios must:

  

Write and sign a Company Contract

Divide roles and responsibilities evenly

Design a Company Name and Logo

Create a shared, “living” document for collaboration
